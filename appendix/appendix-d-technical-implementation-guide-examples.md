# Appendix D - Technical Implementation Guide Examples

The following diagrams show examples taken from the SNOMED CT Technical Implementation Guide January 2013, redrawn using the notation specified in this document. If approved it is anticipated that the diagrams in the SNOMED CT Technical Implementation Guide would be replaced by the examples shown in this section.

For convenience the figure number and original diagram from the SNOMED CT Technical Implementation Guide have been included in this section.

Note that the diagrams drawn in this section are an exact copy of the diagrams from the SNOMED CT Technical Implementation Guide as at January 2013. Some of the concepts represented in the diagrams do not appear in the actual SNOMED CT January 2013 content; however this has been faithfully copied from the current diagrams in the SNOMED CT Technical Implementation Guide.

_Figure 21: Refining a concept to add specificity_ from the SNOMED CT Technical Implementation Guide section 4.2.2.3.3

Would be redrawn as

Note that the redrawn expression diagram is distinguishable from a concept definition of "hand pain" - under the notation specified in this document concept definitions are rendered differently.

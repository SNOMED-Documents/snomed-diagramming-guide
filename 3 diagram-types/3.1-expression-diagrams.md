Expression diagrams are the most general form of diagram, which represent a SNOMED CT expression as defined in the SNOMED CT Compositional Grammar. Diagrams representing expressions may exist on their own, or be part of a larger diagram representing a concept definition or relation between two expressions.

In its simplest form this may simply be a single concept

In more complex scenarios diagrams may represent coordination of attribute types, concepts and concrete values.

In all expressions other than a single concept value[1](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCDIAG/3.1+Expression+Diagrams#Footnote1 "Footnote: Click here to display the footnote") it is necessary to start the diagram with a conjunction dot.

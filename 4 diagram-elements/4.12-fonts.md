# 4.12 Fonts

For consistency, all text within diagram elements are to use a sans-serif font such as "Helvetica" 

[1](https://confluence.ihtsdotools.org/display/DOCDIAG/4.12+Fonts#Footnote1 "Footnote: Click here to display the footnote") and font size is to be consistent across all elements within a single diagram. 

Authors are also strongly encouraged to keep the apparent size of the text in the final image close to that of the surrounding text (usually 8-12 points).

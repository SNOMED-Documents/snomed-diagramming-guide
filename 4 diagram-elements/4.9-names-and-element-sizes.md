# 4.9 Names and element sizes

Each element contains a name as specified. The diagram elements may be resized and/or the text of the name given to the element may be wrapped as needed to achieve readability. When resizing it is highly recommended that concept and attribute elements remain rectangular and wider than they are tall where possible.

Names chosen must be fully specified names or (usually preferred) synonyms as stated, however a single diagram must consistently use either fully specified names or synonyms for all diagram elements.

It is highly recommended that an element's name be preceded by its concept identifier. This is to eliminate any potential ambiguity.
